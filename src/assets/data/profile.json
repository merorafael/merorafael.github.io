Author and collaborator of open-source projects for demonstrating specific technologies.\n\nI am enthusiastic about Java (including its tools and frameworks), but I am also experienced in Golang, JavaScript's ecosystem (Node.js, ECMAScript, TypeScript, Express, Nest, Vue, React, React Native, NativeScript and much more) and PHP (including its tools and frameworks).\n\nVast experience coding IaC (like CloudFormation, SAM and Terraform) and AWS resources, including serverless software architectures (using SQS, SNS, API Gateway, Lambda and much more).\n\nExperience with MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL and some geolocalization (GIS) resources, including performance tuning using replica sets, sharding and other database resources. Some experience with SQL Server and Oracle, but basically making DDL and DML queries.\n\nPersonally, I like anime, manga, comic books, Disney and Pixar movies. I also enjoy playing games as a hobby. I would say that my favourite game is Horizon Zero Dawn and that my favourite movie is Coco, a beautiful Pixar movie.\n\nMy motto is \"Do or do not. There is no try\" (Yoda, Star Wars).",
